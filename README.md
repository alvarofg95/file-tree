This project has two subdirectories, first, yo must run access to server directory and launch it:

```
cd server
npm start
```
Once the server is launched, it should be running on port 3001.
Now you must run the client project, where you could see all the file structure

```
cd client
npm start
```

Then, access to http://localhost:3000 and watch the result
